# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model

# Project Description:
The Titanic Survival Problem is a classic data science challenge aimed at predicting passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, and class. This project focuses on both **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) and **machine learning modeling**.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

**Purpose**: To uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset, providing insights that guide model development.

**Techniques Used**:
**Univariate Analysis**: Examine individual feature distributions.
**Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between pairs of features, e.g., class vs. survival rate.
**Multivariate Analysis**: Analyze interactions among multiple features to assess combined effects on survival.
**Tools**: NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Example: Plotting a correlation matrix to identify feature relationships.

**Machine Learning Modeling**:

**Pre-processing**: Address missing values, select relevant features, and engineer new features to enhance model performance.
**Data Preparation**: Split data into training and test sets, and perform feature scaling for consistency.
**Algorithms**: Apply and compare various models including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines
K-Nearest Neighbors
**Evaluation**: Use accuracy and other metrics to determine the best-performing model.
This approach ensures a robust analysis of factors affecting survival and identifies the most accurate predictive model.
